This is a simple space invaders game coded in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

In the game the player has control over the space ship and the objective is to destroy all the aliens.
For every alien that the player kills they get points which gets added to their score.
Everytime the player destroys all the aliens in a level an new larger and faster set of aliens appears.
The game is over when the aliens reach the same level as the player.

In building this game I learned how to utilize the canvas in such a way that it can constantly display and manipulate images as well as how the user is able to interact with and manipulate these images.
